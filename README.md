# Instructions to run the Team-8 Project file


1. For scraping, run, team8 Indeed Scraping.ipynb file, if you get error, interrupt the kernel and rerun it

2.  Each team mate have made their own dataset.We have combined all scraped datasets and combined it manually as indeed_jobs.csv

3. To run exploratory dataset , run "Team-8 Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb", to get the insights on the Dataset. In this, Data.csv is created after removing all the null values and the Duplicates as well. We have also balanced the imbalanced data. This Data.csv file is used for the classification further.

4. Now for classification model, simply run "Team-8 Indeed Classification.ipynb" for text preprocessing classification model predictions on the test dataset.


5. Our experience for this project is shared in experience.txt
